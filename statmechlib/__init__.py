"""
Package for optimization of statistical mechanical models
=========================================================

statmechlib is a Python package for optimization of general statistical
mechanical models based on arbitrary experimental and quantum chemical data.

It is built on top of the scientific Python libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib)
and designed to be easily integrated with scikit-learn machine learning package. 

The ultimate goal is to provide a unified set of tools for easy and fast
optimization of diverse types of statistical mechanical models, from classical atomistic and
coarse-grained force fields, to semiempirical models, lattice
systems, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.
